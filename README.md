# Online-users-tracking

This simple PHP script will give you the feature to see your online users in your website.

You can see the online users details, for this you must have user management in your application. This script will provide yout list of users from your users master who are online.

There is a flat file to store online users data. This file will be updated whenever a new user login to your website

In this script I have used dummy users list, you have to replace that part with your user master.
